# Advocator: Extended latin support for Anki

> Latin: advocator, advocatoris *m* = assistent, backer

*Advocator* is an add-on providing extended latin support for Anki 2.x. It is 
based on the *[Latin Support](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1548612994)* 
add-on, created by Péter Dimitrov.

## Features

### Already Implemented

 - [x] Write latin characters with ease. (Long vowels like `ā, ē, ī, ō, ū, ȳ` 
   and short vowels like `ă, ĕ, ĭ, ŏ, ŭ, y̆` as well as their capitalized 
   versions are supported.)
 - [x] Allow easy searching for words containing long or short vowels. (A query 
   for `armare` will also return `armāre` as a search result, for example.)

### Planned

 - [ ] Replace vowels with their corresponding long or short vowel not only when
   the editor loses focus or gets closed, but already while writing.
