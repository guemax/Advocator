# Advocator: Extended latin support for Anki

> Latin: advocator, advocatoris *m* = assistent, backer

*Advocator* is an add-on providing extended latin support for Anki 2.x. Is is based on the *[Latin Support](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1548612994)* add-on, created by Péter Dimitrov.

## Features

_Note: I am currently working on these features, so they are only partially supported, but each feature underneath marked with a ticked checkbox is already working._

 - [x] Write latin characters with ease. (Long vowels like `ā, ē, ī, ō, ū, ȳ` and short vowels like `ă, ĕ, ĭ, ŏ, ŭ, y̆` as well as their capitalized versions are supported.)
 - [ ] Allow easy searching for words containing long or short vowels. (A query for `armare` will also return `armāre` as a search result, for example.)
